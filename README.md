open-source Worms tribute fangame written with MiniScript in Mini Micro

## Background

In summer 2019, a group on the [Open Game Art forums](https://opengameart.org/forumtopic/annelids) got inspired to make an open-source game inspired by the classic _Worms!_ games.

(If you want to get involved, posting to that forum is a good way to start.)

## Running the Game
This is a [Mini Micro](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro) game.  All the source code and assets are in the `user.minidisk` folder.  To run it:

1. Download Mini Micro for your platform from [here](https://miniscript.org/MiniMicro).

2. Unpack it, and place it (i.e. Mini Micro.app or MiniMicro.exe) in this folder, next to `README.md` and `user.minidisk`.

3. Double-click the Mini Micro application.

That's it.  Mini Micro automatically looks for a `user.minidis`k (folder or zip file) next to itself, and runs the `startup.ms` script found therein.
